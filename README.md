# BFR Data Analysis Website (Backend)
### Abstract
- **Creates an API for frontend to upload and manage the car's run logs (later abbreviated as "data") stored in a MongoDB database:**  
   Post data request -> backend uploads data to database & updates master file in the database  
   Delete data request -> backend deletes data from database & updates master file in the database
- **Generates real-time customizable time-series graphs and passes to frontend:**    
   Get plot request -> backend gets parameters from query -> sends params to a python script -> python script writes HTML to a temporary local file -> backend reads the local file and sends back to frontend
- **Ask the master file in the database for a hierarchical list of all existing data:**  
   Get datatree request -> backend fetches master file from database -> converts it to a tree-structured JSON and sends back to frontend

### Preparations
- **MongoDB database:** Create a cluster that contains 2 databases: main (for storing data) and master (for storing what data are stored).
   Master: has one collection called "datalists", which has one document. It has one array entry with key "list" and values of type: { "collectionName": data's collection's name, its 2 super folders' names separated by a slash, "entryName": data's name }. Each time a data is uploaded/removed, this list will be updated.  
   Main: has multiple collections whose names are two super folders separated by a slash. Each collection stores multiple entries of type: { "uploader": uploader's name, "uploadDate": a Date object formatted as a string (autogenerated when uploaded), "name": name of the data, "fileName": original file's name (autogenerated when uploaded), "dataDate": a string that represents when this data was acquired (may not be parsable as a Date object), "comments": additional comments, "data": the contents of the log file }
- **Data-plotting Python script**  
   Adapted from this [repository](https://github.com/liug26/bfr-mk8-software/tree/main/data-analysis). Sends arguments to the script and reads outputs (currently from a temporary local file, could also read from stdout).
- **Server**
   Currently hosted on [Render](https://dashboard.render.com/) at https://bfr-data-analysis-backend.onrender.com/  
   Other options to consider: Amazon AWS (12-month free trial), Netlify
